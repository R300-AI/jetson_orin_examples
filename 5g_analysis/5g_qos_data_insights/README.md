## Introduction

An exploratory data analysis is conducted on a database containing information about 5G quality of service (QoS) metrics.

## Import Libraries

Necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn are imported for data manipulation and visualization.

## Load the Dataset

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.

## Basic Summary Statistics

Initial exploration of the dataset is conducted to understand its structure and contents.

## Data Types and Missing Values

Data types of each column are displayed, and missing values are checked to plan for data preprocessing.

## Data Preprocessing

Converting columns to their appropriate data types and standardizing variables for analysis.

## Data Analysis

Segmenting the data based on 'Application_Type' and performing statistical tests.

## Visualizations

Creating visualizations to highlight important patterns and trends in the 5G QoS data.

## Conclusion

Key findings and insights from the data analysis are summarized.
